<b>Best practices:</b>
If you do use it for embodiment questionnaires, I encurage using the questions proposed by Gonzalez-Franco & Peck.

Please cite the full paper accordingly if you are using this questionnaire or the PCA analysis here available.

If you are publishing research work, it is recommended to add a link to the executed .ipynb as a supplementary material together with your submission.

<b>How to use:</b>

1. Log in to a free Microsoft Azure Notebook account (you can use existing microsoft accounts such as your skype login).

2. Clone this notebook, load your own data (replace results.csv) and run the .ipynb on your own questionnaire data.
The questionnaire can have a flexible number of questions.

The computation happens on the Microsoft Cloud, therefore it can be run even from low powered mobile platforms.
Microsoft Azure Notebook is also a great platform to work coraboratively and share the analysis with the community.
